    "# Snakemake Pipeline Placeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a placeholder for the Snakemake workflow integration. The [popgensbi_snakemake](https://github.com/kr-colab/popgensbi_snakemake) repository provides a complete pipeline for simulation‑based inference in population genetics. According to its README, it includes workflows for training neural posterior estimators and predicting parameters from VCF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will initially focus on interactive examples. Later, we will guide participants through configuring and running the Snakemake workflow using a YAML configuration file and the `snakemake` command. Please see the repository documentation for details."

    "1. **Environment setup**: Use `conda` to create an environment from the provided `environment.yaml` in the workflow.\n",
    "2. **Create a configuration file**: Copy one of the example config files (e.g., `workflow/AraTha_2epoch_cnn.yaml`) and adjust parameters such as prior ranges, network architecture and simulation settings to your data.\n",
    "3. **Run the workflow**: Execute the training workflow with Snakemake:\n",
